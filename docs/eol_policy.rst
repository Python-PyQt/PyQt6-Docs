Support for Old Versions of Python
==================================

When a Python version reaches it's end-of-life, support for it will be removed
in the next minor release of PyQt6.  For example, if the current version of
PyQt6 is v6.x.y then the support will be removed in v6.x+1.0.

On this basis support for Python v3.6 will be removed in the first minor
release of 2022.  This is likely to be PyQt6 v6.3.0.
