The base class for implementations of input handlers.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtDataVisualization.QAbstract3DInputHandler` is the base class that is subclassed by different input handling implementations that take input events and translate those to camera and light movements. Input handlers also translate raw input events to slicing and selection events in the scene.
