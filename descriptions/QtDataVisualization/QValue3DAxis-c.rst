    :brief: Manipulates an axis of a graph
    :digest: f221f79e00a5a0520aa47af54417ec66

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtDataVisualization.QValue3DAxis` class manipulates an axis of a graph.

A value axis can be given a range of values and segment and subsegment counts to divide the range into.

Labels are drawn between each segment. Grid lines are drawn between each segment and each subsegment.

**Note:** If visible, there will always be at least two grid lines and labels indicating the minimum and the maximum values of the range, as there is always at least one segment.
