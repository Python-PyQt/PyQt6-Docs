    :brief: Adds a custom label to a graph
    :digest: 93d1e2f2b9e64ab4388f83dbe27c5eec

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtDataVisualization.QCustom3DLabel` class adds a custom label to a graph.

The text, font, position, scaling, rotation, and colors of a custom label can be set. In addition, the visibility of the borders and background of the label can be toggled. Colors, borders, and background are determined by the active theme unless set explicitly.

**Note:** In scaling, the z-coordinate has no effect. Setting the same x- and y-coordinates retains the original font dimensions.
