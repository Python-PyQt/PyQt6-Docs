    :brief: Base class for value axis formatters
    :digest: 8abe875503835f40392db46f91628933

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtDataVisualization.QValue3DAxisFormatter` class is a base class for value axis formatters.

This class provides formatting rules for a linear value 3D axis. Subclass it if you want to implement custom value axes.

The base class has no public API beyond constructors and destructors. It is meant to be only used internally. However, subclasses may implement public properties as needed.
