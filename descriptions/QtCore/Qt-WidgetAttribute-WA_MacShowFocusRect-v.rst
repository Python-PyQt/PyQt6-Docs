Indicates that this widget should get a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QFocusFrame` around it. Some widgets draw their own focus halo regardless of this attribute. Not that the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QWidget.focusPolicy` also plays the main role in whether something is given focus or not, this only controls whether or not this gets the focus frame. This attribute is only applicable to macOS.
