The caret (``^``) and the dollar (``$``) metacharacters in the pattern string are allowed to match, respectively, immediately after and immediately before any newline in the subject string, as well as at the very beginning and at the very end of the subject string. This option corresponds to the ``/m`` modifier in Perl regular expressions.
