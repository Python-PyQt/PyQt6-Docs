Enables key event compression if set, and disables it if not set. By default key compression is off, so widgets receive one key press event for each key press (or more, since autorepeat is usually on). If you turn it on and your program doesn't keep up with key input, Qt may try to compress key events so that more than one character can be processed in each event. For example, a word processor widget might receive 2, 3 or more characters in each QKeyEvent::text(), if the layout recalculation takes too long for the CPU. If a widget supports multiple character unicode input, it is always safe to turn the compression on. Qt performs key event compression only for printable characters. :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.Qt.Modifiers` keys, cursor movement keys, function keys and miscellaneous action keys (e.g. Escape, Enter, Backspace, PrintScreen) will stop key event compression, even if there are more compressible key events available. Platforms other than Mac and X11 do not support this compression, in which case turning it on will have no effect. This is set/cleared by the widget's author.
