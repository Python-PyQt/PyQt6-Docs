By default, Qt Style Sheets disable regular QWidget palette and font propagation. When this flag is enabled, font and palette changes propagate as though the user had manually called the corresponding QWidget methods. See The Style Sheet Syntax - Inheritance for more details. This value was added in Qt 5.7.
