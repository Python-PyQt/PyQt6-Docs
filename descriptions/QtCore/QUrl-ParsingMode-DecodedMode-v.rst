:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUrl` will interpret the URL component in the fully-decoded form, where percent characters stand for themselves, not as the beginning of a percent-encoded sequence. This mode is only valid for the setters setting components of a URL; it is not permitted in the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUrl` constructor, in :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUrl.fromEncoded` or in :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUrl.setUrl`. For more information on this mode, see the documentation for :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUrl.ComponentFormattingOptions`.
