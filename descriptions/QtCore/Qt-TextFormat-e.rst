This enum is used in widgets that can display both plain text and rich text, for example :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QLabel`. It is used for deciding whether a text string should be interpreted as one or the other. This is normally done by passing one of the enum values to a QTextEdit::setTextFormat() function.
