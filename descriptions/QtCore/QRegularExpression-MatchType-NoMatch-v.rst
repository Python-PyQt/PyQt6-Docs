No matching is done. This value is returned as the match type by a default constructed :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QRegularExpressionMatch` or :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QRegularExpressionMatchIterator`. Using this match type is not very useful for the user, as no matching ever happens. This enum value has been introduced in Qt 5.1.
