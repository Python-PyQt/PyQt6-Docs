Prevents the window and its children from automatically embedding themselves into a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QGraphicsProxyWidget` if the parent widget is already embedded. You can set this flag if you want your widget to always be a toplevel widget on the desktop, regardless of whether the parent widget is embedded in a scene or not.
