This enumerated type describes the range of years (in the Gregorian calendar) representable by :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QDateTime`:

All dates strictly between these two years are also representable. Note, however, that the Gregorian Calendar has no year zero.

**Note:** :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QDate` can describe dates in a wider range of years. For most purposes, this makes little difference, as the range of years that :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QDateTime` can support reaches 292 million years either side of 1970.
