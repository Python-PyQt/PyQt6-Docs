Indicates that the widget does not want :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QEvent.Type.ChildAdded` or :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QEvent.Type.ChildRemoved` events sent to its parent. This is rarely necessary but can help to avoid automatic insertion widgets like splitters and layouts. This is set by a widget's author.
