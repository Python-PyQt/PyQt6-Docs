Sets the length of the line to the given finite *length*. :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QLineF` will move the end point - :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QLineF.p2` - of the line to give the line its new length, unless :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QLineF.length` was previously zero, in which case no scaling is attempted.
