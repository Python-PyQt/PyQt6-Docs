Creates a copy of the generator state in the *other* object. If *other* is :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QRandomGenerator.system` or a copy of that, this object will also read from the operating system random-generating facilities. In that case, the sequences generated by the two objects will be different.

In all other cases, the new :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QRandomGenerator` object will start at the same position in the deterministic sequence as the *other* object was. Both objects will generate the same sequence from this point on.

For that reason, it is not advisable to create a copy of :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QRandomGenerator.global_`. If one needs an exclusive deterministic generator, consider instead using :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QRandomGenerator.securelySeeded` to obtain a new object that shares no relationship with the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QRandomGenerator.global_`.
