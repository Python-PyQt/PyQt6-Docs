This variable holds Timezone offsets from UTC are expected to be no lower than this..

The lowest UTC offset of any early 21st century timezone is -12 hours (Baker Island, USA), or 12 hours west of Greenwich.

Historically, until 1844, The Philippines (then controlled by Spain) used the same date as Spain's American holdings, so had offsets close to 16 hours west of Greenwich. As The Philippines was using local solar mean time, it is possible some outlying territory of it may have been operating at more than 16 hours west of Greenwich, but no early 21st century timezone traces its history back to such an extreme.
