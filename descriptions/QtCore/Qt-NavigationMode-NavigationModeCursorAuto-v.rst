The mouse cursor is used to change focus, it is displayed only on non touchscreen devices. The keypad is used to implement a virtual cursor, unless the device has an analog mouse type of input device (e.g. touchpad). This is the recommended setting for an application such as a web browser that needs pointer control on both touch and non-touch devices.
