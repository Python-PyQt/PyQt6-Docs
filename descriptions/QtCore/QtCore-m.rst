    :brief:     The core Qt classes

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore` module contains the core classes, including the
event loop and Qt's signal and slot mechanism.  It also includes platform
independent abstractions for animations, state machines, threads, mapped files,
shared memory, regular expressions, and user and application settings.
