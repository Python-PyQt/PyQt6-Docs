Enables resource sharing between the OpenGL contexts used by classes like QOpenGLWidget and QQuickWidget. This allows sharing OpenGL resources, like textures, between QOpenGLWidget instances that belong to different top-level windows. This attribute must be set before :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QGuiApplication` is constructed. This value was added in Qt 5.4.
