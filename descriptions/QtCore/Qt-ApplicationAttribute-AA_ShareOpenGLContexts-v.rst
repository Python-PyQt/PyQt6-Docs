Enables resource sharing between the OpenGL contexts used by classes like QOpenGLWidget and QQuickWidget. This allows sharing OpenGL resources, like textures, between QOpenGLWidget instances that belong to different top-level windows. This attribute must be set before QGuiApplication is constructed. This value was added in Qt 5.4.
