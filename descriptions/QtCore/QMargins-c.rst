    :digest: da527b0c1f103b494c4eb313ab14e515

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QMargins` class defines the four margins of a rectangle.

QMargin defines a set of four margins; left, top, right and bottom, that describe the size of the borders surrounding a rectangle.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QMargins.isNull` function returns ``true`` only if all margins are set to zero.

QMargin objects can be streamed as well as compared.
