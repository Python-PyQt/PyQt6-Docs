    :digest: 09f0eef18b7812a6e12cf7f9d144b8c9

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QMargins` class defines the four margins of a rectangle.

QMargin defines a set of four margins; left, top, right, and bottom, that describe the size of the borders surrounding a rectangle.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QMargins.isNull` function returns ``true`` only if all margins are set to zero.

QMargin objects can be streamed as well as compared.
