This signal is emitted after columns have been moved within the model. The items between *start* and *end* inclusive, under the given *parent* item have been moved to *destination* starting at the column *column*.

**Note:** Components connected to this signal use it to adapt to changes in the model's dimensions. It can only be emitted by the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QAbstractItemModel` implementation, and cannot be explicitly emitted in subclass code.
