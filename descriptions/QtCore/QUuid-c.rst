    :brief: Stores a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)
    :digest: b2d7b1c2eca1f66ce2b7391cafbdd3de

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid` class stores a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).

Using *U*\ niversally *U*\ nique *ID*\ entifiers (UUID) is a standard way to uniquely identify entities in a distributed computing environment. A UUID is a 16-byte (128-bit) number generated by some algorithm that is meant to guarantee that the UUID will be unique in the distributed computing environment where it is used. The acronym GUID is often used instead, *G*\ lobally *U*\ nique *ID*\ entifiers, but it refers to the same thing.

.. _quuid-variant-field:

Actually, the GUID is one *variant* of UUID. Multiple variants are in use. Each UUID contains a bit field that specifies which type (variant) of UUID it is. Call :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid.variant` to discover which type of UUID an instance of :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid` contains. It extracts the three most significant bits of byte 8 of the 16 bytes. In :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid`, byte 8 is ``QUuid::data4[0]``. If you create instances of :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid` using the constructor that accepts all the numeric values as parameters, use the following table to set the three most significant bits of parameter ``b1``, which becomes ``QUuid::data4[0]`` and contains the variant field in its three most significant bits. In the table, 'x' means *don't care*.

+------+------+------+-----------------------------------------+
| msb0 | msb1 | msb2 | Variant                                 |
+======+======+======+=========================================+
| 0    | x    | x    | NCS (Network Computing System)          |
+------+------+------+-----------------------------------------+
| 1    | 0    | x    | DCE (Distributed Computing Environment) |
+------+------+------+-----------------------------------------+
| 1    | 1    | 0    | Microsoft (GUID)                        |
+------+------+------+-----------------------------------------+
| 1    | 1    | 1    | Reserved for future expansion           |
+------+------+------+-----------------------------------------+

.. _quuid-version-field:

If :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid.variant` returns :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid.Variant.DCE`, the UUID also contains a *version* field in the four most significant bits of ``QUuid::data3``, and you can call :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid.version` to discover which version your :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid` contains. If you create instances of :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid` using the constructor that accepts all the numeric values as parameters, use the following table to set the four most significant bits of parameter ``w2``, which becomes ``QUuid::data3`` and contains the version field in its four most significant bits.

+------+------+------+------+----------------+
| msb0 | msb1 | msb2 | msb3 | Version        |
+======+======+======+======+================+
| 0    | 0    | 0    | 1    | Time           |
+------+------+------+------+----------------+
| 0    | 0    | 1    | 0    | Embedded POSIX |
+------+------+------+------+----------------+
| 0    | 0    | 1    | 1    | Md5(Name)      |
+------+------+------+------+----------------+
| 0    | 1    | 0    | 0    | Random         |
+------+------+------+------+----------------+
| 0    | 1    | 0    | 1    | Sha1           |
+------+------+------+------+----------------+

The field layouts for the DCE versions listed in the table above are specified in the Network Working Group UUID Specification.

Most platforms provide a tool for generating new UUIDs, e.g. ``uuidgen`` and ``guidgen``. You can also use :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid.createUuid`. UUIDs generated by :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid.createUuid` are of the random type. Their :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid.Version` bits are set to :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid.Version.Random`, and their :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid.Variant` bits are set to :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid.Variant.DCE`. The rest of the UUID is composed of random numbers. Theoretically, this means there is a small chance that a UUID generated by :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid.createUuid` will not be unique. But it is `a  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_Unique_Identifier#Random_UUID_probability_of_duplicates>`_ small chance.

UUIDs can be constructed from numeric values or from strings, or using the static :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid.createUuid` function. They can be converted to a string with :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid.toString`. UUIDs have a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid.variant` and a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid.version`, and null UUIDs return true from :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUuid.isNull`.
