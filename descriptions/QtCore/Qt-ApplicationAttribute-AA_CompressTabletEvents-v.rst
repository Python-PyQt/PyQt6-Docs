Enables compression of input events from tablet devices. Notice that AA_CompressHighFrequencyEvents must be true for events compression to be enabled, and that this flag extends the former to tablet events. Currently supported on the X11 windowing system, Windows 8 and above. The default value is false. This value was added in Qt 5.10.
