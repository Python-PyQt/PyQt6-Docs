The timeline is not running. This is the initial state of :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QTimeLine`, and the state :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QTimeLine` reenters when finished. The current time, frame and value remain unchanged until either :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QTimeLine.setCurrentTime` is called, or the timeline is started by calling :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QTimeLine.start`.
