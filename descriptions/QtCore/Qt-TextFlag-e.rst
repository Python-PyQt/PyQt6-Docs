This enum type is used to define some modifier flags. Some of these flags only make sense in the context of printing:

You can use as many modifier flags as you want, except that Qt::TextSingleLine and Qt::TextWordWrap cannot be combined.

Flags that are inappropriate for a given use are generally ignored.
