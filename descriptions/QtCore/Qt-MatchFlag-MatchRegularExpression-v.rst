Performs string-based matching using a regular expression as the search term. Uses :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QRegularExpression`. When using this flag, a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QRegularExpression` object can be passed as parameter and will directly be used to perform the search. The case sensitivity flag will be ignored as the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QRegularExpression` object is expected to be fully configured. This enum value was added in Qt 5.15.
