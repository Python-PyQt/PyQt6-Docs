This enum type describes the different mouse buttons.

**Note:** Some models of multi-button mice are pre-configured with high-numbered Buttons emulating keyboard sequences, for use in specific games. In order for these Buttons to be seen as actual 'Mouse Buttons', the device must be re-configured (using the vendor's configuration tool).
