This variable holds Timezone offsets from UTC are expected to be no higher than this..

The highest UTC offset of any early 21st century timezone is +14 hours (Christmas Island, Kiribati, Kiritimati), or 14 hours east of Greenwich.

Historically, before 1867, when Russia sold Alaska to America, Alaska used the same date as Russia, so had offsets over 15 hours east of Greenwich. As Alaska was using local solar mean time, its offsets varied, but all were less than 16 hours east of Greenwich.
