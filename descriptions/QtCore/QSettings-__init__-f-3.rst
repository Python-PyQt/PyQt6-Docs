Constructs a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QSettings` object for accessing the settings stored in the file called *fileName*, with parent *parent*. If the file doesn't already exist, it is created.

If *format* is :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QSettings.Format.NativeFormat`, the meaning of *fileName* depends on the platform. On Unix, *fileName* is the name of an INI file. On macOS and iOS, *fileName* is the name of a ``.plist`` file. On Windows, *fileName* is a path in the system registry.

If *format* is :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QSettings.Format.IniFormat`, *fileName* is the name of an INI file.

**Warning:** This function is provided for convenience. It works well for accessing INI or ``.plist`` files generated by Qt, but might fail on some syntaxes found in such files originated by other programs. In particular, be aware of the following limitations:

* :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QSettings` provides no way of reading INI "path" entries, i.e., entries with unescaped slash characters. (This is because these entries are ambiguous and cannot be resolved automatically.)

* In INI files, :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QSettings` uses the ``@`` character as a metacharacter in some contexts, to encode Qt-specific data types (e.g., ``@Rect``), and might therefore misinterpret it when it occurs in pure INI files.
