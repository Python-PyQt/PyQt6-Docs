Adds the translation file *translationFile* to the list of translation files to be used for translations.

Multiple translation files can be installed. Translations are searched for in the reverse order in which they were installed, so the most recently installed translation file is searched first and the first translation file installed is searched last. The search stops as soon as a translation containing a matching string is found.

Installing or removing a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QTranslator`, or changing an installed :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QTranslator` generates a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QEvent.Type.LanguageChange` event for the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QCoreApplication` instance. A :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QApplication` instance will propagate the event to all toplevel widgets, where a reimplementation of changeEvent can re-translate the user interface by passing user-visible strings via the tr() function to the respective property setters. User-interface classes generated by Qt Widgets Designer provide a ``retranslateUi()`` function that can be called.

The function returns ``true`` on success and ``false`` on failure.

**Note:** :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QCoreApplication` does *not* take ownership of *translationFile*. It is the responsibility of the application to ensure that, if the function returned ``true``, the *translationFile* object is alive until either :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QCoreApplication.removeTranslator` is called for it, or the application exits.
