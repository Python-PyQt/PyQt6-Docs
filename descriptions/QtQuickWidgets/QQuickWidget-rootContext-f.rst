This function returns the root of the context hierarchy. Each QML component is instantiated in a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQml.QQmlContext`. :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQml.QQmlContext`'s are essential for passing data to QML components. In QML, contexts are arranged hierarchically and this hierarchy is managed by the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQml.QQmlEngine`.
