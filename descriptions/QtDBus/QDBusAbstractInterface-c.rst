    :brief: The base class for all D-Bus interfaces in the Qt D-Bus binding, allowing access to remote interfaces
    :digest: 09d5617c202b8686088ed53d6333ce74

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtDBus.QDBusAbstractInterface` class is the base class for all D-Bus interfaces in the Qt D-Bus binding, allowing access to remote interfaces.

Generated-code classes also derive from :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtDBus.QDBusAbstractInterface`, all methods described here are also valid for generated-code classes. In addition to those described here, generated-code classes provide member functions for the remote methods, which allow for compile-time checking of the correct parameters and return values, as well as property type-matching and signal parameter-matching.
