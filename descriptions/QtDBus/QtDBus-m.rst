    :brief:     Classes to support IPC using the D-Bus protocol

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtDBus` module contains classes to support the D-Bus
protocol.  D-Bus is an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) and Remote Procedure
Calling (RPC) mechanism originally developed for Linux to replace existing and
competing IPC solutions with one unified protocol.  It has also been designed
to allow communication between system-level processes (such as printer and
hardware driver services) and normal user processes.
