Sets the generated flag for the field called *name* to *generated*. If the field does not exist, nothing happens. Only fields that have *generated* set to true are included in the SQL that is generated by :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtSql.QSqlQueryModel` for example.

**Note:** In Qt versions prior to 6.8, this function took QString, not QAnyStringView.
