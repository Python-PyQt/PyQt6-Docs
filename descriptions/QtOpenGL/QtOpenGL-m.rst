    :brief:     Classes for using OpenGL in PyQt user interfaces

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtOpenGL` module contains classes that allow the use of
code written in the OpenGL graphics API with both :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick` and
:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets` user interfaces.  This can be useful when the
application has its own OpenGL-dependent code, or when it is integrating with a
third-party OpenGL-based renderer.
