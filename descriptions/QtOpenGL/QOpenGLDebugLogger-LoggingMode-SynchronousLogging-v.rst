Messages from the OpenGL server are logged synchronously and sequentially. This has a severe performance hit, as OpenGL implementations are very asynchronous by nature; but it's very useful to debug OpenGL problems, as OpenGL guarantees that the messages generated by a OpenGL command will be logged before the corresponding command execution has returned. Therefore, you can install a breakpoint on the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtOpenGL.QOpenGLDebugLogger.messageLogged` signal and see in the backtrace which OpenGL command caused it; the only caveat is that if you are using OpenGL from multiple threads you may need to force direct connection when connecting to the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtOpenGL.QOpenGLDebugLogger.messageLogged` signal.
