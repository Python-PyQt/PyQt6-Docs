    :brief:     Classes for rendering 3D Qt Quick content

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick3D` module provides a high-level API for creating
3D content or UIs based on Qt Quick.  Rather than using an external engine
which creates syncing issues, and additional layers of abstraction, it provides
extensions to the existing Qt Quick scenegraph for spatial content, and a
renderer for that extended scenegraph.  When using the Spatial scenegraph it is
also be possible to mix Qt Quick 2D content with 3D content.
