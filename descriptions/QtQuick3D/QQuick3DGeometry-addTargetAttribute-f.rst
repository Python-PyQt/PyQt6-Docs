This is an overloaded function.

Adds morph target attribute description. Each attribute has a targetId which the attribute belongs to, a semantic, which specifies the usage of the attribute and the number of components it has, an offset from the beginning to the vertex to the attribute location inside a vertex, and a stride which is a byte size between the elements.
