    :brief: Container for resolved data to be added to surface graphs
    :digest: 7bc5f7f8b21baa3569c98e81e7ed37ed

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QSurfaceDataItem` class provides a container for resolved data to be added to surface graphs.

A surface data item holds the data for a single vertex in a surface graph. Surface data proxies parse data into :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QSurfaceDataItem` instances for surface graphs.
