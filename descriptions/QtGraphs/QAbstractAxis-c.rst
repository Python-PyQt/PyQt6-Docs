The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QAbstractAxis` class is a base class used for specialized axis classes.

Each series can be bound to only one horizontal and vertical axis.

The properties and visibility of various axis elements, such as axis line, title, labels, and grid lines, can be individually controlled.
