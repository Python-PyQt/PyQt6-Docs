    :brief: The data proxy for 3D scatter graphs
    :digest: 7f5c4541d1749aa068adf18846d9033b

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QScatterDataProxy` class is the data proxy for 3D scatter graphs.

A scatter data proxy handles adding, inserting, changing, and removing data items. Since data is stored in series, it is necessary to create a series associated with the proxy before using these functions for the dataset.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QScatterDataProxy` takes ownership of all QtGraphs::QScatterDataArray and :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QScatterDataItem` objects passed to it.
