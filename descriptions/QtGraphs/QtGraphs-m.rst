    :brief:  Classes to support the visualization of data in 2D and 3D graphs.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs` module provides a set of easy to use 2D and 3D
visualization components.

In the 3D realm there is support for bar, scatter, and surface graphs.  It is
especially useful for visualizing depth maps and large quantities of rapidly
changing data, such as data received from multiple sensors.  The look and feel
of graphs can be customized by using themes or by adding custom items and
labels.

In the 2D realm, there is support for area, bar, donut, line, pie, scatter and
spline graphs, and they are easily combinable with any other QML content.

This module should be used in preference to the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCharts` and
:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtDataVisualization` modules where possible.
