Indicates the graph will be first rendered to an offscreen surface that is then drawn during normal QML item rendering. The rendered image is antialiased using the multisampling method if it is supported in the current environment and the msaaSamples property value is greater than zero. This rendering mode offers good quality and normal QML item behavior at the expense of performance.
