    :brief: Base class for 3D value axis formatters
    :digest: 51b81b3d2dfc8db7cee4181bff43b625

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QValue3DAxisFormatter` class is a base class for 3D value axis formatters.

This class provides formatting rules for a linear value 3D axis. Subclass it if you want to implement custom value axes.

The base class has no public API beyond constructors and destructors. It is meant to be only used internally. However, subclasses may implement public properties as needed.
