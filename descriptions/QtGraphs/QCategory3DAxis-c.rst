    :digest: c6dd07920f703f964f880a234d741a01

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QCategory3DAxis` class manipulates an axis of a graph.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QCategory3DAxis` provides an axis that can be given labels. The axis is divided into equal-sized categories based on the data window size defined by setting the axis range.

Grid lines are drawn between categories, if visible. Labels are drawn to positions of categories if provided.
