    :brief: Model mapper for pie series
    :digest: 217077d6c63a5c981016015fcb59fc27

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QPieModelMapper` is a model mapper for pie series.

Model mappers enable using a data model derived from the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QAbstractItemModel` class as a data source for a graph. A model mapper is used to create a connection between a data model and :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QPieSeries`.

Both model and pie series properties can be used to manipulate the data. The model mapper keeps the pie series and the data model in sync.
