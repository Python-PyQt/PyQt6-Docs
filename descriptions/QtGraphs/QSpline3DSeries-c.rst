The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QSpline3DSeries` class represents a data series as a spline.

Spline graphs are used to show information as a series of data points connected by a curved or straight Catmull-Rom spline.

This class manages the spline specific visual elements.

`Spline3DSeries <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qtgraphs-spline3dseries.html>`_ extends the `Scatter3DSeries <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qtgraphs-scatter3dseries.html>`_ API.
