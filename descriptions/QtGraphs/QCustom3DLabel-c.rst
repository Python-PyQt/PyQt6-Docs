    :brief: Adds a custom label to a graph
    :digest: a103bd46725ece5819c7899c9dd8eef6

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QCustom3DLabel` class adds a custom label to a graph.

The text, font, position, scaling, rotation, and colors of a custom label can be set. In addition, the visibility of the borders and background of the label can be toggled. Colors, borders, and background are determined by the active theme unless set explicitly.

**Note:** In scaling, the z-coordinate has no effect. Setting the same x- and y-coordinates retains the original font dimensions.
