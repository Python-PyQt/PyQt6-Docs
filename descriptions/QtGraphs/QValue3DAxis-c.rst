    :brief: Manipulates an axis of a graph
    :digest: f24d1606d7cee3a47b04222c8c32ddf2

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QValue3DAxis` class manipulates an axis of a graph.

A value axis can be given a range of values and segment and subsegment counts to divide the range into.

Labels are drawn between each segment, and grid lines are drawn between each segment and each subsegment.

**Note:** If visible, there will always be at least two grid lines and labels indicating the minimum and maximum values of the range, as there is always at least one segment.
