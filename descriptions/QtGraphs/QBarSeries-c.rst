    :brief: Presents data in bar graphs
    :digest: 39e48a7fbc66c2d1142ecdd1fd2970f1

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QBarSeries` class presents data in bar graphs.

This class draws data by default as a series of bars grouped by category, with one bar per category from each bar set added to the series. It also supports horizontal bars and grouping bars as stacked.

A bar series needs the `GraphsView <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qtgraphs-graphsview.html>`_ x-axis to be set to a `BarCategoryAxis <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qtgraphs-barcategoryaxis.html>`_ and the y-axis set to `ValueAxis <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qtgraphs-valueaxis.html>`_.
