    :brief: Presents data in area graphs
    :digest: ad2255052e229aea77e57c429c65815c

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QAreaSeries` class presents data in area graphs.

An area graph is used to draw an area composed by points. The points are defined by two series: :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QAreaSeries.upperSeries` and :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QAreaSeries.lowerSeries`. The area between the series is drawn as a graph. If only the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QAreaSeries.upperSeries` is defined, the area is then between the bottom of the graph and the upper series.
