The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QAbstractDataProxy` class is a base class for all 3D graph proxies.

The following graphs type specific inherited classes are used instead of the base class: :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QBarDataProxy`, :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QScatterDataProxy`, and :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGraphs.QSurfaceDataProxy`.
