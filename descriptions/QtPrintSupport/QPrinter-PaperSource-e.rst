This enum type specifies what paper source :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtPrintSupport.QPrinter` is to use. :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtPrintSupport.QPrinter` does not check that the paper source is available; it just uses this information to try and set the paper source. Whether it will set the paper source depends on whether the printer has that particular source.

**Warning:** This is currently only implemented for Windows.
