The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtPrintSupport.QPrinterInfo` class gives access to information about existing printers.

Use the static functions to generate a list of :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtPrintSupport.QPrinterInfo` objects. Each :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtPrintSupport.QPrinterInfo` object in the list represents a single printer and can be queried for name, supported paper sizes, and whether or not it is the default printer.
