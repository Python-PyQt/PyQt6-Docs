Inhibits playback of media content until the user interacts with the page. By default, `WebEngine <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qtwebengine-webengine.html>`_ uses Chromium settings, as described in `Autoplay Policy Changes <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes>`_. This is similar to how Chrome on Android behaves, while the default behavior when it is disabled is similar to Chrome on desktops. To overwrite the default behavior, disable this setting. (Added in Qt 5.11)
