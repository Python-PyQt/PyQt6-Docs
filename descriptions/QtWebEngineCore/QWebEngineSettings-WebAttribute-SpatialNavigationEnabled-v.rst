Enables the Spatial Navigation feature, which means the ability to navigate between focusable elements, such as hyperlinks and form controls, on a web page by using the Left, Right, Up and Down arrow keys. For example, if a user presses the Right key, heuristics determine whether there is an element they might be trying to reach towards the right and which element they probably want. Disabled by default.
