Enables cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for this scheme. This flag is required in order for content to be loaded by documents of a different origin, this includes access from other schemes. The appropriate CORS headers are generated automatically by the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWebEngineCore.QWebEngineUrlRequestJob` class. By default only ``http`` and ``https`` are CORS enabled. (Added in Qt 5.14)
