    :brief: Way to construct QWebEngineProfile
    :digest: 64bb2f56f5eb2d16d98129f64f34ae39

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWebEngineCore.QWebEngineProfileBuilder` class provides a way to construct :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWebEngineCore.QWebEngineProfile`.

A :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWebEngineCore.QWebEngineProfileBuilder` creates an instance of :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWebEngineCore.QWebEngineProfile` class. Some profile's properties have to be initialized in one call and should not be modified during profile lifetime. The web engine profile builder simply guards that.
