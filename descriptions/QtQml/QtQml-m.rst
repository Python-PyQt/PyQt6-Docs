    :brief:     Classes for integrating with the QML language

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQml` module contains classes to allow applications to
integrate support for QML and JavaScript.  Python objects can be exported to
QML or be created from QML in the same way that Qt allows the same with C++
instances.  See :ref:`ref-integrating-qml` for a fuller description of how to
do this.
