The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QTextItem` class provides all the information required to draw text in a custom paint engine.

When you reimplement your own paint engine, you must reimplement :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QPaintEngine.drawTextItem`, a function that takes a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QTextItem` as one of its arguments.
