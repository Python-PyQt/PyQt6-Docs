In this type of device, the touch surface and display are integrated. This means the surface and display typically have the same size, such that there is a direct relationship between the touch points' physical positions and the coordinate reported by :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QEventPoint`. As a result, Qt allows the user to interact directly with multiple QWidgets, QGraphicsItems, or Qt Quick Items at the same time.
