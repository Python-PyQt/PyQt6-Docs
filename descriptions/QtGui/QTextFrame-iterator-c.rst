    :brief: Iterator for reading the contents of a QTextFrame
    :digest: a13d94c7a9055efeb3b6b8b49b232059

The iterator class provides an iterator for reading the contents of a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QTextFrame`.

A frame consists of an arbitrary sequence of :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QTextBlock`\ s and child :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QTextFrame`\ s. This class provides a way to iterate over the child objects of a frame, and read their contents. It does not provide a way to modify the contents of the frame.
