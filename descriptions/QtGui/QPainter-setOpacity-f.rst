Sets the opacity of the painter to *opacity*. The value should be in the range 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 is fully transparent and 1.0 is fully opaque.

The opacity set on the painter applies to each drawing operation separately. Filling a shape and drawing its outline are treated as separate drawing operations.
