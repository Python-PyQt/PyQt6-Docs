    :brief: Represents a vector or vertex in 2D space

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QVector2D` class represents a vector or vertex in 2D space.

Vectors are one of the main building blocks of 2D representation and drawing. They consist of two finite floating-point coordinates, traditionally called x and y.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QVector2D` class can also be used to represent vertices in 2D space. We therefore do not need to provide a separate vertex class.
