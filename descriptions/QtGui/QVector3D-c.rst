    :brief: Represents a vector or vertex in 3D space
    :digest: c4361dbb54ba2061033695f676503f7b

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QVector3D` class represents a vector or vertex in 3D space.

Vectors are one of the main building blocks of 3D representation and drawing. They consist of three coordinates, traditionally called x, y, and z.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QVector3D` class can also be used to represent vertices in 3D space. We therefore do not need to provide a separate vertex class.
