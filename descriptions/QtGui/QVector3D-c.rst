    :brief: Represents a vector or vertex in 3D space
    :digest: 7f1fcc5bcac1c0e60df4d9de91a30edc

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QVector3D` class represents a vector or vertex in 3D space.

Vectors are one of the main building blocks of 3D representation and drawing. They consist of three finite floating-point coordinates, traditionally called x, y, and z.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QVector3D` class can also be used to represent vertices in 3D space. We therefore do not need to provide a separate vertex class.
