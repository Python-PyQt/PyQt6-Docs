Constructs an empty picture.

The *formatVersion* parameter may be used to *create* a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QPicture` that can be read by applications that are compiled with earlier versions of Qt.

Note that the default formatVersion is -1 which signifies the current release, i.e. for Qt 4.0 a formatVersion of 7 is the same as the default formatVersion of -1.

Reading pictures generated by earlier versions of Qt is not supported in Qt 4.0.
