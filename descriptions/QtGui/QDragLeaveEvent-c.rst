The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QDragLeaveEvent` class provides an event that is sent to a widget when a drag and drop action leaves it.

This event is always preceded by a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QDragEnterEvent` and a series of :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QDragMoveEvent`\ s. It is not sent if a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QDropEvent` is sent instead.

.. seealso:: :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QDragEnterEvent`, :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QDragMoveEvent`, :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QDropEvent`.
