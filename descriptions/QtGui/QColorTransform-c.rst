    :brief: Transformation between color spaces
    :digest: 5680bc5526e8e3405faacdb4313c755a

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QColorTransform` class is a transformation between color spaces.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QColorTransform` is an instantiation of a transformation between color spaces. It can be applied on color and pixels to convert them from one color space to another.

Setting up a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QColorTransform` takes some preprocessing, so keeping around QColorTransforms that you need often is recommended, instead of generating them on the fly.
