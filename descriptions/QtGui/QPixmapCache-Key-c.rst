    :brief: QPixmapCache::Key class can be used for efficient access to the QPixmapCache
    :digest: 18b97a105ceb22f4820ecf9d2cb8a508

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QPixmapCache.Key` class can be used for efficient access to the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QPixmapCache`.

Use :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QPixmapCache.insert` to receive an instance of Key generated by the pixmap cache. You can store the key in your own objects for a very efficient one-to-one object-to-pixmap mapping.
