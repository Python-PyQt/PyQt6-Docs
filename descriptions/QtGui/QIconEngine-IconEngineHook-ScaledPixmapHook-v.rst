Provides a way to get a pixmap that is scaled according to the given scale (typically equal to the device pixel ratio). The *data* argument of the virtual_hook() function is a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QIconEngine.ScaledPixmapArgument` pointer that contains both the input and output arguments. This enum value was added in Qt 5.9.
