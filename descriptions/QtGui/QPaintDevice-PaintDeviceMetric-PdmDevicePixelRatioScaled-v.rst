The scaled device pixel ratio for the device. This is identical to PdmDevicePixelRatio, except that the value is scaled by a constant factor in order to support paint devices with fractional scale factors. The constant scaling factor used is devicePixelRatioFScale(). This enum value has been introduced in Qt 5.6.
