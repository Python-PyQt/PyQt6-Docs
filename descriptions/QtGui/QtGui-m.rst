    :brief:     The core classes common to widget and OpenGL GUIs

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui` module contains classes for windowing system
integration, event handling, 2D graphics, basic imaging, fonts and text.
Application developers would normally use this with higher level APIs such as
those contained in the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets` module.
