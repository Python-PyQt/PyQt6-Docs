Causes an alert to be shown for *msec* miliseconds. If *msec* is ``0`` (the default), then the alert is shown indefinitely until the window becomes active again. This function has no effect on an active window.

In alert state, the window indicates that it demands attention, for example by flashing or bouncing the taskbar entry.
