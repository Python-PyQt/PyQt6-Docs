This signal is emitted when the current frame has been resized to *size*. This effect is sometimes used in animations as an alternative to replacing the frame. You can call :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QMovie.currentImage` or :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QMovie.currentPixmap` to get a copy of the updated frame.
