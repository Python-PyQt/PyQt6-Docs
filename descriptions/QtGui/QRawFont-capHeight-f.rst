Returns the cap height of this :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QRawFont` in pixel units.

The cap height of a font is the height of a capital letter above the baseline. It specifically is the height of capital letters that are flat - such as H or I - as opposed to round letters such as O, or pointed letters like A, both of which may display overshoot.
