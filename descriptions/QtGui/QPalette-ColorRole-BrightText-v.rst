A text color that is very different from ``WindowText``, and contrasts well with e.g. ``Dark``. Typically used for text that needs to be drawn where ``Text`` or ``WindowText`` would give poor contrast, such as on pressed push buttons. Note that text colors can be used for things other than just words; text colors are *usually* used for text, but it's quite common to use the text color roles for lines, icons, etc.
