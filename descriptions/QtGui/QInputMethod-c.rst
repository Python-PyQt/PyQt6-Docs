The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QInputMethod` class provides access to the active text input method.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QInputMethod` is used by the text editors for integrating to the platform text input methods and more commonly by application views for querying various text input method-related information like virtual keyboard visibility and keyboard dimensions.

Qt Quick also provides access to :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QInputMethod` in QML through `Qt global object <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qtqml-qt.html>`_ as ``Qt.inputMethod`` property.
