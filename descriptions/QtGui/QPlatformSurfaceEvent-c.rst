    :brief: Used to notify about native platform surface events
    :digest: 224f7ca75daa23b38a89cfe6b00f4c26

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QPlatformSurfaceEvent` class is used to notify about native platform surface events.

Platform window events are synchronously sent to windows and offscreen surfaces when their underlying native surfaces are created or are about to be destroyed.

Applications can respond to these events to know when the underlying platform surface exists.
