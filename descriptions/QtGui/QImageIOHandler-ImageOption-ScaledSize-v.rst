The scaled size of the image. A handler that supports this option is expected to scale the image to the provided size (a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QSize`), after applying any clip rect transformation (). If the handler does not support this option, :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QImageReader` will perform the scaling after the image has been read.
