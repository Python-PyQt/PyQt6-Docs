    :brief: Represents a vector or vertex in 4D space
    :digest: 4e2ccf6c2f7eb84490d5a664eeb56ae1

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QVector4D` class represents a vector or vertex in 4D space.

Vectors are one of the main building blocks of 4D affine representations of 3D space. They consist of four finite floating-point coordinates, traditionally called x, y, z and w.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QVector4D` class can also be used to represent vertices in 4D space. We therefore do not need to provide a separate vertex class.
