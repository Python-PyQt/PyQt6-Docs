If possible, render text with hinting in both horizontal and vertical directions. The text will be altered to optimize legibility on the target device, but since the metrics will depend on the target size of the text, the positions of glyphs, line breaks, and other typographical detail will not scale, meaning that a text layout may look different on devices with different pixel densities.
