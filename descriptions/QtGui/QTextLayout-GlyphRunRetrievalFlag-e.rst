GlyphRunRetrievalFlag specifies flags passed to the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QTextLayout.glyphRuns` functions to determine which properties of the layout are returned in the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QGlyphRun` objects. Since each property will consume memory and may require additional allocations, it is a good practice to only request the properties you will need to access later.
