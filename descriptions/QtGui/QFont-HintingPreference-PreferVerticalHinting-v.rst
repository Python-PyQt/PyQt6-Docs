If possible, render text with no horizontal hinting, but align glyphs to the pixel grid in the vertical direction. The text will appear crisper on displays where the density is too low to give an accurate rendering of the glyphs. But since the horizontal metrics of the glyphs are unhinted, the text's layout will be scalable to higher density devices (such as printers) without impacting details such as line breaks.
