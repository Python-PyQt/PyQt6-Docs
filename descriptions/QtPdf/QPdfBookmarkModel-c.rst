The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtPdf.QPdfBookmarkModel` class holds a tree of links (anchors) within a PDF document, such as the table of contents.

This is used in the `Model/View Programming <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/model-view-programming.html>`_ paradigm to display a table of contents in the form of a tree or list.
