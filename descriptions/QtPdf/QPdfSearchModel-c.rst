The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtPdf.QPdfSearchModel` class searches for a string in a PDF document and holds the results.

This is used in the `Model/View Programming <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/model-view-programming.html>`_ paradigm to display a list of search results, to highlight them on the rendered PDF pages, and to iterate through them using the "search forward" / "search backward" buttons and shortcuts that would be found in a typical document-viewing UI:
