Navigation history within a PDF document.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtPdf.QPdfPageNavigator` class remembers which destinations the user has visited in a PDF document, and provides the ability to traverse backward and forward. It is used to implement back and forward actions similar to the back and forward buttons in a web browser.
