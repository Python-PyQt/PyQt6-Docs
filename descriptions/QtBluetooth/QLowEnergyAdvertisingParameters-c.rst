The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtBluetooth.QLowEnergyAdvertisingParameters` class represents the parameters used for Bluetooth Low Energy advertising.

When running the advertising procedure, a number of parameters can be configured, such as how fast to advertise or which clients, if any, can connect to the advertising device. These parameters are set via this class, and their values will be used when advertising is started by calling :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtBluetooth.QLowEnergyController.startAdvertising`.
