    :brief:     Classes to support connectivity between Bluetooth enabled devices

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtBluetooth` module contains classes to support
connectivity between Bluetooth enabled devices.  Bluetooth is a short-range
(less than 100 meters) wireless technology.  It has a reasonably high data
transfer rate of 2.1 Mbit/s, which makes it ideal for transferring data between
devices.  Bluetooth connectivity is based on basic device management, such as
scanning for devices, gathering information about them, and exchanging data
between them.
