Performs a minimal service discovery. The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtBluetooth.QBluetoothServiceInfo` objects returned may be incomplete and are only guaranteed to contain device and service UUID information. Since a minimal discovery relies on cached SDP data it may not find a physically existing device until a ``FullDiscovery`` is performed.
