Device discovery is not possible or implemented on the current platform. The error is set in response to a call to :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtBluetooth.QBluetoothDeviceDiscoveryAgent.start`. An example for such cases are iOS versions below 5.0 which do not support Bluetooth device search at all. This value was introduced by Qt 5.5.
