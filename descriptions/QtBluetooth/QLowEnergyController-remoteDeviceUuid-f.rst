Returns the unique identifier of the remote Bluetooth Low Energy device.

On macOS/iOS/tvOS CoreBluetooth does not expose/accept hardware addresses for LE devices; instead developers are supposed to use unique 128-bit UUIDs, generated by CoreBluetooth. These UUIDS will stay constant for the same central <-> peripheral pair and we use them when connecting to a remote device. For a controller in the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtBluetooth.QLowEnergyController.Role.CentralRole`, this value will always be the one passed in when the controller object was created. For a controller in the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtBluetooth.QLowEnergyController.Role.PeripheralRole`, this value is invalid.
