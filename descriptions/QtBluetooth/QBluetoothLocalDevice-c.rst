    :brief: Enables access to the local Bluetooth device
    :digest: dcab59898f1307dfee6cfcf4bed5c4d9

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtBluetooth.QBluetoothLocalDevice` class enables access to the local Bluetooth device.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtBluetooth.QBluetoothLocalDevice` provides functions for getting and setting the state of local Bluetooth devices.

On iOS, this class cannot be used because the platform does not expose any data or API which may provide information on the local Bluetooth device.
