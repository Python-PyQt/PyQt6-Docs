    :brief: Enables access to the local Bluetooth device
    :digest: 7de281a41a0210b71f28201f01f91d7d

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtBluetooth.QBluetoothLocalDevice` class enables access to the local Bluetooth device.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtBluetooth.QBluetoothLocalDevice` provides functions for getting and setting the state of local Bluetooth devices.

On iOS and Windows, this class cannot be used because the platform does not expose any data or API which may provide information on the local Bluetooth device.
