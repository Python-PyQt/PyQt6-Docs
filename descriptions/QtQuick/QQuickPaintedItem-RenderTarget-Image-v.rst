The default; :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QPainter` paints into a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QImage` using the raster paint engine. The image's content needs to be uploaded to graphics memory afterward, this operation can potentially be slow if the item is large. This render target allows high quality anti-aliasing and fast item resizing.
