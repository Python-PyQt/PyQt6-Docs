graphics context creation failed. This typically means that no suitable OpenGL implementation was found, for example because no graphics drivers are installed and so no OpenGL 2 support is present. On mobile and embedded boards that use OpenGL ES such an error is likely to indicate issues in the windowing system integration and possibly an incorrect configuration of Qt.
