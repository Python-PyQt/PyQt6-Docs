    :brief: Convenience class for drawing solid filled rectangles using scenegraph
    :digest: 378394bbf21d8a0518cc0387f44caca0

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick.QSGSimpleRectNode` class is a convenience class for drawing solid filled rectangles using scenegraph.

**Warning:** This utility class is only functional when running with the default or software backends of the Qt Quick scenegraph. As an alternative, prefer using :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick.QSGRectangleNode` via :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick.QQuickWindow.createRectangleNode`. However, this standalone class is still useful when used via subclassing and the application knows that no special scenegraph backends will be involved.
