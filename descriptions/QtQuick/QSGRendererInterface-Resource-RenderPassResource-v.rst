The resource is a pointer to the main render pass used by the scenegraph, describing the color and depth/stecil attachments and how they are used. For example, a ``VkRenderPass \*``. Note that the value always reflects the main render target (either the on-screen window or the texture :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick.QQuickRenderControl` redirects to) and it does not depend on the Qt Quick scene, meaning it does not take any additional texture-targeting render passes generated by `ShaderEffect <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qtquick-shadereffect.html>`_ or :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick.QQuickItem` layers into account. This value was introduced in Qt 5.14.
