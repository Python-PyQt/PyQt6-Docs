As of Qt 6.9, this value will enable hardware-accelerated painting as long as the rendering API used is OpenGL, otherwise it will be ignored. For versions Qt 6.0 to Qt 6.8, it will be ignored on all rendering APIs. This will usually give better rendering performance, but at the expense of antialiasing quality.
