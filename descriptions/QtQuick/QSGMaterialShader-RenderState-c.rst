Encapsulates the current rendering state during a call to :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick.QSGMaterialShader.updateUniformData` and the other ``update`` type of functions.

The render state contains a number of accessors that the shader needs to respect in order to conform to the current state of the scene graph.
