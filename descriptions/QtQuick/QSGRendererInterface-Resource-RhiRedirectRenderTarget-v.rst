The resource is a pointer to a QRhiTextureRenderTarget instance that is associated with the window and its :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick.QQuickRenderControl`. The value is null when the window is not associated with a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick.QQuickRenderControl`. Note that the value always reflects the main texture render target and it does not depend on the Qt Quick scene, meaning it does not take any additional texture-targeting render passes generated by `ShaderEffect <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qtquick-shadereffect.html>`_ or :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick.QQuickItem` layers into account. This value was introduced in Qt 6.0.
