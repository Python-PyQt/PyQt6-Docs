Specifies the drawing mode, also called primitive topology.

**Note:** Starting with Qt 6 the scene graph only exposes topologies that are supported across all the supported 3D graphics APIs. As a result, the values ``DrawLineLoop`` and ``DrawTriangleFan`` are no longer supported at run time in Qt 6, even though the enum values themselves are still present.
