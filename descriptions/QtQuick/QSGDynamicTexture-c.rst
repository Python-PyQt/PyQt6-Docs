    :brief: Serves as a baseclass for dynamically changing textures, such as content that is rendered to FBO's
    :digest: 3a95944dbff65b432bcc5db1b495c595

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick.QSGDynamicTexture` class serves as a baseclass for dynamically changing textures, such as content that is rendered to FBO's.

To update the content of the texture, call :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick.QSGDynamicTexture.updateTexture` explicitly.

**Note:** All classes with QSG prefix should be used solely on the scene graph's rendering thread. See `Scene Graph and Rendering <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html#scene-graph-and-rendering>`_ for more information.
