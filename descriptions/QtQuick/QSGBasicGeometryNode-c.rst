    :brief: Serves as a baseclass for geometry based nodes
    :digest: af5c2f9bacf7bcd9b5fce4567b5ddf49

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick.QSGBasicGeometryNode` class serves as a baseclass for geometry based nodes.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick.QSGBasicGeometryNode` class should not be used by itself. It is only encapsulates shared functionality between the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick.QSGGeometryNode` and :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtQuick.QSGClipNode` classes.

**Note:** All classes with QSG prefix should be used solely on the scene graph's rendering thread. See `Scene Graph and Rendering <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html#scene-graph-and-rendering>`_ for more information.
