The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DRender.QRasterMode` render state allows to control the type of rasterization to be performed.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DRender.QRasterMode` class is used to control the rasterization step of the primitives at render time. This can be used to choose whether we only want to show points, edges or fill a primitive.

**Note:** This is not supported when rendering on OpenGL ES 2.0 platforms.
