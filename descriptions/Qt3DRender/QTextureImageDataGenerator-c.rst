Provides texture image data for QAbstractTextureImage.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DRender.QTextureImageDataGenerator` is a data provider for QAbstractTexture. :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DRender.QTextureImageDataGenerator` can be used to expand Qt3D with more ways to load texture image data as well as support user-defined formats and formats Qt3D does not natively support. The data is returned by the QTextureImageDataPtr which contains the data that will be loaded to the texture. :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DRender.QTextureImageDataGenerator` is executed by Aspect jobs in the backend.
