Provides a way of enabling child entities based on distance or screen size.

This component is assigned to an entity. When the entity changes distance relative to the camera, the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DRender.QLevelOfDetailSwitch` will disable all the child entities except the one matching index Qt3DRender::QLevelOfDetailSwitch::currentIndex.
