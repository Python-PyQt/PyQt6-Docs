Provides a way of specifying a render target.

A :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DRender.QRenderTargetSelector` is used to select active :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DRender.QRenderTarget` for the FrameGraph. When :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DRender.QRenderTargetSelector` is present in the FrameGraph, the rendering is directed into QTexture objects or draw buffers instead of the surface specified in the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DRender.QRenderSurfaceSelector`.
