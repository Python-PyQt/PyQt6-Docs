The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DRender.QStencilMask` class controls the front and back writing of individual bits in the stencil planes.

A :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DRender.QStencilMask` class specifies a write mask for the stencil values after the stencil test. Mask can be specified separately for the front-facing and back-facing polygons. The fragment stencil value is and'd with the mask before it is written to the stencil buffer.
