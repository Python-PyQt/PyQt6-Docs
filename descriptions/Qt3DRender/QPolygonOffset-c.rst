The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DRender.QPolygonOffset` class sets the scale and steps to calculate depth values for polygon offsets.

A :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DRender.QPolygonOffset` class adds an offset to the fragment depth value prior to depth test and depth write. The offset can be used to avoid z-fighting when rendering polygons with very close depth values such as decals.
