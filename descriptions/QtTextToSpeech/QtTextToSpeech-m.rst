    :brief:  Support for synthesizing speech from text and playing it as audio output

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtTextToSpeech` module enables a PyQt application to read
out text by using speech synthesis.  This is especially useful in scenarios
where the end-user cannot access the application's visual interface, for
example, when driving or operating machinery.  In such setups, the module can
be used to read out incoming notifications or to provide turn-by-turn
navigation instructions.
