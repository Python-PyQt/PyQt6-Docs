The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DExtras.QConeGeometry` class allows creation of a cone in 3D space.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DExtras.QConeGeometry` class is most commonly used internally by the QConeMesh but can also be used in custom :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DRender.QGeometryRenderer` subclasses. The class allows for creation of both a cone and a truncated cone.
