    :digest: 0895f15bb352fbdd86d5a6c34787061c

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DExtras.QExtrudedTextGeometry` class allows creation of a 3D extruded text in 3D space.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DExtras.QExtrudedTextGeometry` class is most commonly used internally by the QText3DMesh but can also be used in custom :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DRender.QGeometryRenderer` subclasses.

The origin of the geometry is the rear left end of the text's baseline.
