Caching is enabled at the paint device level, in device coordinates. This mode is for items that can move, but are not rotated, scaled or sheared. If the item is transformed directly or indirectly, the cache will be regenerated automatically. Unlike ItemCoordinateCacheMode,  always renders at maximum quality.
