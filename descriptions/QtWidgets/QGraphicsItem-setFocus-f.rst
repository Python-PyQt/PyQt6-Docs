Gives keyboard input focus to this item. The *focusReason* argument will be passed into any :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QFocusEvent` generated by this function; it is used to give an explanation of what caused the item to get focus.

Only enabled items that set the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QGraphicsItem.GraphicsItemFlags.ItemIsFocusable` flag can accept keyboard focus.

If this item is not visible, not active, or not associated with a scene, it will not gain immediate input focus. However, it will be registered as the preferred focus item for its subtree of items, should it later become visible.

As a result of calling this function, this item will receive a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QGraphicsItem.focusInEvent` with *focusReason*. If another item already has focus, that item will first receive a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QGraphicsItem.focusOutEvent` indicating that it has lost input focus.
