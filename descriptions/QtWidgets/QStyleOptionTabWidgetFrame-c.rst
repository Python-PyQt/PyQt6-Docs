    :digest: 260d31e54738c3df0fd73f87b3f5ce77

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionTabWidgetFrame` class is used to describe the parameters for drawing the frame around a tab widget.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionTabWidgetFrame` contains all the information that :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyle` functions need to draw the frame around :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QTabWidget`.

For performance reasons, there are few member functions and the access to the member variables is direct (i.e., using the ``.`` or ``->`` operator). This makes the structures straightforward to use and emphasizes that these are simply parameters used by the style functions.
