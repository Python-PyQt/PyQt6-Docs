    :brief: Used to describe the parameters used to draw an item in a view widget
    :digest: 4a180bdc0b81112f831667653b61a0dc

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionViewItem` class is used to describe the parameters used to draw an item in a view widget.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionViewItem` contains all the information that :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyle` functions need to draw the items for Qt's model/view classes.

For performance reasons, there are few member functions and the access to the member variables is direct (i.e., using the ``.`` or ``->`` operator). This makes the structures straightforward to use and emphasizes that these are simply parameters used by the style functions.
