    :brief: Used to describe the parameters for drawing a title bar
    :digest: d82a7a1d0bfc5c709d77404d881611eb

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionTitleBar` class is used to describe the parameters for drawing a title bar.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionTitleBar` contains all the information that :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyle` functions need to draw the title bar of a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QMdiSubWindow`.

For performance reasons, there are few member functions and the access to the member variables is direct (i.e., using the ``.`` or ``->`` operator). This makes the structures straightforward to use and emphasizes that these are simply parameters used by the style functions.
