This enum describes :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QGraphicsItem`'s cache modes. Caching is used to speed up rendering by allocating and rendering to an off-screen pixel buffer, which can be reused when the item requires redrawing. For some paint devices, the cache is stored directly in graphics memory, which makes rendering very quick.
