This enum is used to describe the position of a toolbar line, as well as the toolbar's position within the line.

The order of the positions within a line starts at the top of a vertical line, and from the left within a horizontal line. The order of the positions for the lines is always from the parent widget's boundary edges.

.. seealso:: positionWithinLine, positionOfLine.
