Creates the standard context menu, which is shown when the user clicks on the scroll bar with the right mouse button. It is called from the default :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QScrollBar.contextMenuEvent` handler and takes the *position* where the mouse click was in this widget's local coordinates. The popup menu's ownership is transferred to the caller.
