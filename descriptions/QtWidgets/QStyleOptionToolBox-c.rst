The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionToolBox` class is used to describe the parameters needed for drawing a tool box.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionToolBox` contains all the information that :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyle` functions need to draw :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QToolBox`.

For performance reasons, there are few member functions and the access to the member variables is direct (i.e., using the ``.`` or ``->`` operator). This makes the structures straightforward to use and emphasizes that these are simply parameters used by the style functions.
