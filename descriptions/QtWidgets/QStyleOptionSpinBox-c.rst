    :brief: Used to describe the parameters necessary for drawing a spin box
    :digest: 8c7cc7d0f11f95dcc1d6f1441f1db74c

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionSpinBox` class is used to describe the parameters necessary for drawing a spin box.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionSpinBox` contains all the information that :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyle` functions need to draw :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QSpinBox` and :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QDateTimeEdit`.

For performance reasons, there are few member functions and the access to the member variables is direct (i.e., using the ``.`` or ``->`` operator). This makes the structures straightforward to use and emphasizes that these are simply parameters used by the style functions.
