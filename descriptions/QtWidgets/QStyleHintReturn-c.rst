    :brief: Style hints that return more than basic data types
    :digest: dc5543b79bb6686e6687ff40b45fbe8a

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleHintReturn` class provides style hints that return more than basic data types.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleHintReturn` and its subclasses are used to pass information from a style back to the querying widget. This is most useful when the return value from :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyle.styleHint` does not provide enough detail; for example, when a mask is to be returned.
