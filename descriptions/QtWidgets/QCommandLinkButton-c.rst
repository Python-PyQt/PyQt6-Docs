    :brief: Vista style command link button

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QCommandLinkButton` widget provides a Vista style command link button.

The command link is a new control that was introduced by Windows Vista. Its intended use is similar to that of a radio button in that it is used to choose between a set of mutually exclusive options. Command link buttons should not be used by themselves but rather as an alternative to radio buttons in Wizards and dialogs and makes pressing the "next" button redundant. The appearance is generally similar to that of a flat pushbutton, but it allows for a descriptive text in addition to the normal button text. By default it will also carry an arrow icon, indicating that pressing the control will open another window or page.
