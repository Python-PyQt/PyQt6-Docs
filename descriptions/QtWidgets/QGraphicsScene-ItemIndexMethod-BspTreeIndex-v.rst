A Binary Space Partitioning tree is applied. All :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QGraphicsScene`'s item location algorithms are of an order close to logarithmic complexity, by making use of binary search. Adding, moving and removing items is logarithmic. This approach is best for static scenes (i.e., scenes where most items do not move).
