The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QKeySequenceEdit` widget allows to input a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QKeySequence`.

This widget lets the user choose a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QKeySequence`, which is usually used as a shortcut. The recording is initiated when the widget receives the focus and ends one second after the user releases the last key.
