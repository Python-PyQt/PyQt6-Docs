This event handler is called if a drag is in progress, and when any of the following conditions occur: the cursor enters this widget, the cursor moves within this widget, or a modifier key is pressed on the keyboard while this widget has the focus. The event is passed in the *event* parameter.

See the `Drag-and-drop documentation <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/dnd.html>`_ for an overview of how to provide drag-and-drop in your application.
