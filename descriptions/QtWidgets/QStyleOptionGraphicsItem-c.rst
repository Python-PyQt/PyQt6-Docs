    :brief: Used to describe the parameters needed to draw a QGraphicsItem
    :digest: 1d3cf0619fbb622551dc52362d369bd1

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionGraphicsItem` class is used to describe the parameters needed to draw a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QGraphicsItem`.

For performance reasons, there are few member functions and the access to the member variables is direct (i.e., using the ``.`` or ``->`` operator). This makes the structures straightforward to use and emphasizes that these are simply parameters used by the style functions.
