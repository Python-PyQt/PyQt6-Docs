    :brief: Used to describe the parameters for drawing a focus rectangle with QStyle
    :digest: 03400b483fc0760c3fe8bff7c20456f3

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionFocusRect` class is used to describe the parameters for drawing a focus rectangle with :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyle`.

For performance reasons, there are few member functions and the access to the member variables is direct (i.e., using the ``.`` or ``->`` operator). This makes the structures straightforward to use and emphasizes that these are simply parameters used by the style functions.
