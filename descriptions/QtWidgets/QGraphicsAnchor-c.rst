    :brief: Represents an anchor between two items in a QGraphicsAnchorLayout
    :digest: c2d07bd1c8a49c43e9a94d46cf6c1398

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QGraphicsAnchor` class represents an anchor between two items in a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QGraphicsAnchorLayout`.

The graphics anchor provides an API that enables you to query and manipulate the properties an anchor has. When an anchor is added to the layout with :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QGraphicsAnchorLayout.addAnchor`, a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QGraphicsAnchor` instance is returned where the properties are initialized to their default values. The properties can then be further changed, and they will be picked up the next time the layout is activated.
