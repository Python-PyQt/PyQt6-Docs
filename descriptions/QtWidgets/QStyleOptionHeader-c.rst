    :brief: Used to describe the parameters for drawing a header
    :digest: 5d13e4dc42f81507e7772ae616d9e0f7

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionHeader` class is used to describe the parameters for drawing a header.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionHeader` contains all the information that :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyle` functions need to draw the item views' header pane, header sort arrow, and header label.

For performance reasons, there are few member functions and the access to the member variables is direct (i.e., using the ``.`` or ``->`` operator). This makes the structures straightforward to use and emphasizes that these are simply parameters used by the style functions.
