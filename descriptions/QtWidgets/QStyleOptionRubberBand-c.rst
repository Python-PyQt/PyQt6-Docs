    :digest: aace14f8defa8d1377bfebf0fe8cf3f7

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionRubberBand` class is used to describe the parameters needed for drawing a rubber band.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionRubberBand` contains all the information that :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyle` functions need to draw :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QRubberBand`.

For performance reasons, there are few member functions and the access to the member variables is direct (i.e., using the ``.`` or ``->`` operator). This makes the structures straightforward to use and emphasizes that these are simply parameters used by the style functions.
