    :digest: eee9c33b3b93c172f2165588da9feda3

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionDockWidget` class is used to describe the parameters for drawing a dock widget.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyleOptionDockWidget` contains all the information that :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QStyle` functions need to draw graphical elements like :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QDockWidget`.

For performance reasons, there are few member functions and the access to the member variables is direct (i.e., using the ``.`` or ``->`` operator). This makes the structures straightforward to use and emphasizes that these are simply parameters used by the style functions.
