The item is stacked behind its parent. By default, child items are stacked on top of the parent item. But setting this flag, the child will be stacked behind it. This flag is useful for drop shadow effects and for decoration objects that follow the parent item's geometry without drawing on top of it. This flag was introduced in Qt 4.5.
