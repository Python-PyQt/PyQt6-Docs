Returns the last child of this widget that :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QWidget.setFocus` had been called on. For top level widgets this is the widget that will get focus in case this window gets activated

This is not the same as :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QApplication.focusWidget`, which returns the focus widget in the currently active window.
