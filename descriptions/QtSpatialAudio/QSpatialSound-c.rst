A sound object in 3D space.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtSpatialAudio.QSpatialSound` represents an audible object in 3D space. You can define its position and orientation in space, set the sound it is playing and define a volume for the object.

The object can have different attenuation behavior, emit sound mainly in one direction or spherically, and behave as if occluded by some other object.
