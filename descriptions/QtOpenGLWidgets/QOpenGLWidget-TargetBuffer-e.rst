Specifies the buffer to use when stereoscopic rendering is enabled, which is toggled by setting :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QSurfaceFormat.FormatOption.StereoBuffers`.

**Note:** LeftBuffer is always the default and used as fallback value when stereoscopic rendering is disabled or not supported by the graphics driver.
