A class providing morph targets to blend-shape animation.

A :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DAnimation.QMorphTarget` class is a convenience class, which provides a list of :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DCore.QAttribute`, which the QMorphingAnimation uses to animate geometry. A :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DAnimation.QMorphTarget` can also be created based on existing :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DCore.QGeometry`.
