An abstract base class for Qt3D animations.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DAnimation.QAbstractAnimation` is an abstract base class for all animations. :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DAnimation.QAbstractAnimation` can not be directly instantiated, but rather through its subclasses. :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DAnimation.QAbstractAnimation` specifies common properties for all Qt3D animations, such as animation name and type, current position and animation duration, while leaving the actual animating for the subclasses.
