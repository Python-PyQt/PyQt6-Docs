    :brief: Defines a channel for a QAnimationClipData. The animation system interpolates each channel component independently except in the case the QChannel is called "Rotation" (case sensitive), it has four QChannelComponents and the same number of keyframes for each QChannelComponent. In that case the interpolation will be performed using SLERP

Defines a channel for a QAnimationClipData. The animation system interpolates each channel component independently except in the case the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DAnimation.QChannel` is called "Rotation" (case sensitive), it has four QChannelComponents and the same number of keyframes for each QChannelComponent. In that case the interpolation will be performed using SLERP.
