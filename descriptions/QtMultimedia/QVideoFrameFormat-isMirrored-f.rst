Returns ``true`` if the surface is mirrored around its vertical axis. This is typically needed for video frames coming from a front camera of a mobile device.

**Note:** The mirroring here differs from :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QImage.mirrored`, as a vertically mirrored :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtGui.QImage` will be mirrored around its x-axis.
