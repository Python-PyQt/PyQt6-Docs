Used to load a skeleton of joints from file.

Use `SkeletonLoader <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qt3d-core-skeletonloader.html>`_ if you wish to load a whole skeleton from file rather than creating the joints yourself using Skeleton and Joints. Creating a skeleton and binding the vertices of a mesh to the skeleton is most easily performed in a 3D digital content creation tool such as Blender. The resulting skeleton and mesh can then be exported in a suitable format such as glTF 2 for consumption by Qt 3D.
