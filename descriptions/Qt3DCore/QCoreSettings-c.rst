The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DCore.QCoreSettings` class holds settings related to core data handling process.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DCore.QCoreSettings` component should be set as a component of the scene root entity (although it could be anywhere in the scene graph). There should be a single instance.

It can be used to control some of Qt 3D's behavior.
