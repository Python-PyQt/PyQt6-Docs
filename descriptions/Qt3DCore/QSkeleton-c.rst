Holds the data for a skeleton to be used with skinned meshes.

Use :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DCore.QSkeleton` if you wish to manually create the joints of a skeleton for use with skinned meshes. This is mainly of use to people creating editors, tooling, or dynamic skeletons. It is more common that a Qt 3D application would simply consume an existing skeleton and skinned mesh as created in a digital content creation tool such as Blender. For this use case, please see QSkeletonLoader.
