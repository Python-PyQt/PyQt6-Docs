Used to transforms parts of skinned meshes.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DCore.QJoint` node is used to build skeletons as part of the skinned mesh support in Qt 3D. A joint can be transformed by way of its scale, rotation and translation properties. Any mesh vertices that are bound to the joint will have their transformations updated accordingly.
