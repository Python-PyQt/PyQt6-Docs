Encapsulates geometry.

A :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DCore.QGeometry` class is used to group a list of :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DCore.QAttribute` objects together to form a geometric shape Qt3D is able to render using Qt3DCore::QGeometryRenderer. Special attribute can be set in order to calculate bounding volume of the shape.
