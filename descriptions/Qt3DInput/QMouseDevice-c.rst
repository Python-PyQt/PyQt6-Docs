Delegates mouse events to the attached `MouseHandler <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qt3d-input-mousehandler.html>`_ objects.

A :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.Qt3DInput.QMouseDevice` delegates mouse events from physical mouse device to QMouseHandler objects. The sensitivity of the mouse can be controlled with the QMouseDevice::sensitivity property, which specifies the rate in which the logical mouse coordinates change in response to physical movement of the mouse.

.. seealso:: QMouseHandler.
