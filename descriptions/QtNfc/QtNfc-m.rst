    :brief:     Classes to support connectivity between NFC enabled devices

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNfc` module contains classes that provide connectivity
between NFC enabled devices.  The NFC API provides APIs for interacting with
NFC Forum Tags and NFC Forum Devices, including target detection and loss,
registering NDEF message handlers, reading and writing NDEF messages on NFC
Forum Tags and sending tag specific commands.
