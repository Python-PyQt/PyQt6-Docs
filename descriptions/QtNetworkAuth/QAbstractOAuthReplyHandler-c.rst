Handles replies to OAuth authentication requests.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetworkAuth.QAbstractOAuthReplyHandler` class handles the answers to all OAuth authentication requests. This class is designed as a base whose subclasses implement custom behavior in the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetworkAuth.QAbstractOAuthReplyHandler.callback` and :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetworkAuth.QAbstractOAuthReplyHandler.networkReplyFinished` methods.
