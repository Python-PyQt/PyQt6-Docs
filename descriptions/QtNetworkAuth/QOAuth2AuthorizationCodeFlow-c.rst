    :digest: 84ded3d878d418498773a2dbf83ad9b3

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetworkAuth.QOAuth2AuthorizationCodeFlow` class provides an implementation of the `Authorization Code Grant <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1>`_ flow.

This class implements the `Authorization Code Grant <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1>`_ flow, which is used both to obtain and to refresh access tokens. It is a redirection-based flow so the user will need access to a web browser.
