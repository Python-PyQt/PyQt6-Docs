    :brief: Displays the legend of a chart
    :digest: ff0b0adfc205f564a22dff89d5aee62a

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCharts.QLegend` class displays the legend of a chart.

A legend is a graphical object that displays the legend of a chart. The legend state is updated by :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCharts.QChart` when series change. By default, the legend is attached to the chart, but it can be detached to make it independent of chart layout. Legend objects cannot be created or deleted, but they can be referenced via the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCharts.QChart` class.
