The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCharts.QLegendMarker` class is an abstract object that can be used to access markers within a legend.

A legend marker consists of an icon and a label. The icon color corresponds to the color used to draw a series and the label displays the name of the series (or the label of the slice for a pie series or bar set for a bar series). A legend marker is always related to one series, slice, or bar set.
