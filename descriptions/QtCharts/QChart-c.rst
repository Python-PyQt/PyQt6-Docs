    :digest: abd8baad5f3b2114e3651669ccebdba1

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCharts.QChart` class manages the graphical representation of the chart's series, legends, and axes.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCharts.QChart` is a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QGraphicsWidget` that you can show in a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtWidgets.QGraphicsScene`. It manages the graphical representation of different types of series and other chart related objects like legend and axes. To simply show a chart in a layout, the convenience class :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCharts.QChartView` can be used instead of :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCharts.QChart`. In addition, line, spline, area, and scatter series can be presented as polar charts by using the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCharts.QPolarChart` class.
