When *interactive* is ``true`` and the legend is detached, the legend is able to be moved and resized with a mouse in a similar way to a window.

The legend will automatically attach to an edge of the chart by dragging it off of that edge. Double clicking an attached legend will detach it. This is ``false`` by default.
