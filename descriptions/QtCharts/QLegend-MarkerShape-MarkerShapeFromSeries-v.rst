The marker shape is determined by the series. In case of a scatter series, the legend marker looks like a scatter dot and is the same size as the dot. In case of a line or spline series, the legend marker looks like a small segment of the line. For other series types, rectangular markers are shown. If a ``lightMarker`` is specified for a series, the ``lightMarker`` will be shown and its size will be determined by the series marker size.
