This enum describes the theme used by the chart.

A theme is a built-in collection of UI style related settings applied to all the visual elements of a chart, such as colors, pens, brushes, and fonts of series, as well as axes, title, and legend. The `Charts with Widgets Gallery <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtcharts-chartsgallery-example.html>`_ illustrates how to use themes.

**Note:** Changing the theme will overwrite all customizations previously applied to the series.
