    :brief: Defines a geographic area
    :digest: 50862815eb3e0366826edd0bf4cf9a55

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtPositioning.QGeoShape` class defines a geographic area.

This class is the base class for classes which specify a geographic area.

For the sake of consistency, subclasses should describe the specific details of the associated areas in terms of :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtPositioning.QGeoCoordinate` instances and distances in meters.

This class is a Q_GADGET since Qt 5.5. It can be `directly used from C++ and QML <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/positioning-cpp-qml.html#cpp-value-integration-positioning>`_.
