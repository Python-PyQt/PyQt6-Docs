    :brief:     Classes for obtaining positioning information from satellite, wifi etc.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtPositioning` module contains classes to determine a
position by using a variety of possible sources, including satellite, or wifi,
or a text file, and so on.  That information can then be used to, for example,
determine a position on a map.  In addition satellite information can be
retrieved and area based monitoring can be performed.
