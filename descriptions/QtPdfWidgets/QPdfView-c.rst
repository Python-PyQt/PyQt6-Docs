A PDF viewer widget.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtPdfWidgets.QPdfView` is a PDF viewer widget that offers a user experience similar to many common PDF viewer applications, with two :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtPdfWidgets.QPdfView.pageMode`. In the ``MultiPage`` mode, it supports flicking through the pages in the entire document, with narrow gaps between the page images. In the ``SinglePage`` mode, it shows one page at a time.
