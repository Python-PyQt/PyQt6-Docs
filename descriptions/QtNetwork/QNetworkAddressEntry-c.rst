    :digest: 1b916a47c7690cc8072be1c0f358d0cc

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QNetworkAddressEntry` class stores one IP address supported by a network interface, along with its associated netmask and broadcast address.

Each network interface can contain zero or more IP addresses, which in turn can be associated with a netmask and/or a broadcast address (depending on support from the operating system).

This class represents one such group.
