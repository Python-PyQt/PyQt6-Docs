Requests only, type: :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QMetaType.Type.Bool` (default: false) If set, this attribute will tell :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QNetworkAccessManager` to attempt an upgrade to HTTP/2 over cleartext (also known as h2c). Until Qt 7 the default value for this attribute can be overridden to true by setting the QT_NETWORK_H2C_ALLOWED environment variable. This attribute is ignored if the  is not set. (This value was introduced in 6.3.)
