Sets the socket receive buffer size in bytes at the OS level. This maps to the SO_RCVBUF socket option. This option does not affect the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QIODevice` or :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QAbstractSocket` buffers (see :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QAbstractSocket.setReadBufferSize`). This enum value has been introduced in Qt 5.3.
