:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QSslSocket` will request a certificate from the peer during the SSL handshake phase, and requires that this certificate is valid. On failure, :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QSslSocket` will emit the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QSslSocket.sslErrors` signal. This mode is the default for clients.
