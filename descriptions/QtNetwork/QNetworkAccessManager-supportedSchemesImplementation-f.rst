Lists all the URL schemes supported by the access manager.

You should not call this function directly; use :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QNetworkAccessManager.supportedSchemes` instead.

Because of binary compatibility constraints, the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QNetworkAccessManager.supportedSchemes` method (introduced in Qt 5.2) was not virtual in Qt 5, but now it is. Override the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QNetworkAccessManager.supportedSchemes` method rather than this one.
