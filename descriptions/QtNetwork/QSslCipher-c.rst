The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QSslCipher` class represents an SSL cryptographic cipher.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QSslCipher` stores information about one cryptographic cipher. It is most commonly used with :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QSslSocket`, either for configuring which ciphers the socket can use, or for displaying the socket's ciphers to the user.
