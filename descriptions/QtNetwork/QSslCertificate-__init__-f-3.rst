Constructs a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QSslCertificate` by parsing the *format* encoded *data* and using the first available certificate found. You can later call :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QSslCertificate.isNull` to see if *data* contained a certificate, and if this certificate was loaded successfully.
