Constructs a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QSslCertificate` by reading *format* encoded data from *device* and using the first certificate found. You can later call :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QSslCertificate.isNull` to see if *device* contained a certificate, and if this certificate was loaded successfully.
