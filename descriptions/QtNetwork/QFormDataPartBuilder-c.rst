    :digest: 178d20b74dde66cf92a2bb78aaac9dd8

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QFormDataPartBuilder` class is a convenience class to simplify the construction of :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QHttpPart` objects.

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QFormDataPartBuilder` class can be used to build a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QHttpPart` object with the content disposition header set to be form-data by default. Then the generated object can be used as part of a multipart message (which is represented by the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QHttpMultiPart` class).
