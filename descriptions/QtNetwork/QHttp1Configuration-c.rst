The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QHttp1Configuration` class controls HTTP/1 parameters and settings.

:sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QHttp1Configuration` controls HTTP/1 parameters and settings that :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QNetworkAccessManager` will use to send requests and process responses.

**Note:** The configuration must be set before the first request was sent to a given host (and thus an HTTP/1 session established).

.. seealso:: :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QNetworkRequest.setHttp1Configuration`, :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QNetworkRequest.http1Configuration`, :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QNetworkAccessManager`.
