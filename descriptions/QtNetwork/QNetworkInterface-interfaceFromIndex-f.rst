Returns a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QNetworkInterface` object for the interface whose internal ID is *index*. Network interfaces have a unique identifier called the "interface index" to distinguish it from other interfaces on the system. Often, this value is assigned progressively and interfaces being removed and then added again get a different value every time.

This index is also found in the IPv6 address' scope ID field.
