Attribute codes for the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QNetworkRequest` and :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtNetwork.QNetworkReply`.

Attributes are extra meta-data that are used to control the behavior of the request and to pass further information from the reply back to the application. Attributes are also extensible, allowing custom implementations to pass custom values.

The following table explains what the default attribute codes are, the `QVariant <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtcore-changes-qt6.html#qvariant>`_ types associated, the default value if said attribute is missing and whether it's used in requests or replies.
