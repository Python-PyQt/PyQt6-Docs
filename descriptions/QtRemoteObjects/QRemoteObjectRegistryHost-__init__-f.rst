Constructs a new :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtRemoteObjects.QRemoteObjectRegistryHost` Node with the given *parent*. RegistryHost Nodes have the same functionality as :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtRemoteObjects.QRemoteObjectHost` Nodes, except rather than being able to connect to a :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtRemoteObjects.QRemoteObjectRegistry`, the provided Host :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QUrl` (\ *registryAddress*) becomes the address of the registry for other Nodes to connect to.
