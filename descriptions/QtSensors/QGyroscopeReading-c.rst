    :brief: Represents one reading from the gyroscope sensor
    :digest: f779cb295fd4e3a10220f8fd5b59d4db

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtSensors.QGyroscopeReading` class represents one reading from the gyroscope sensor.

.. _qgyroscopereading-qgyroscopereading-units:

QGyroscopeReading Units
.......................

The reading contains 3 values, measured in degrees per second that define the movement of the device around the x, y and z axes. Unlike :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtSensors.QRotationReading`, the values represent the current angular velocity rather than a fixed rotation. The measurements are in degrees per second.
