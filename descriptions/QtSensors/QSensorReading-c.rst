    :digest: fd337e921e0e67b14f236cf11a85c205

The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtSensors.QSensorReading` class holds the readings from the sensor.

Note that :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtSensors.QSensorReading` is not particularly useful by itself. The interesting data for each sensor is defined in a sub-class of :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtSensors.QSensorReading`.
