The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtSensors.QProximityReading` class represents one reading from the proximity sensor.

.. _qproximityreading-qproximityreading-units:

The proximity sensor can only indicate if an object is close or not.

The distance at which an object is considered close is device-specific. This distance may be available in the :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtSensors.QSensor.outputRanges` property.
