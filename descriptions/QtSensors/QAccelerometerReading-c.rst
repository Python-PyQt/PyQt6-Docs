The :sip:ref:`~PyQt6.QtSensors.QAccelerometerReading` class reports on linear acceleration along the X, Y and Z axes.

QAccelerometerReading Units
...........................

The scale of the values is meters per second squared. The axes are arranged as follows.

A monoblock device sitting at rest, face up on a desk will experience a force of approximately 9.8 on the Z axis (ie. towards the roof). This is the proper acceleration the device experiences relative to freefall.
